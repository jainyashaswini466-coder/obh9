❌ If we check divisible by 4 LAST

Example: 1900 => it is divisbile by 400

Divisible by 100 → might say NOT leap

But we never check 400 properly

Wrong result ❌

❌ If we check divisible by 100 first

Example: 2012

Not divisible by 100 → might say NOT leap

But it is divisible by 4

Wrong result ❌

❌ If we check divisible by 400 first

Example: 2024

Not divisible by 400 → might say NOT leap

But it is a leap year

Wrong result ❌
